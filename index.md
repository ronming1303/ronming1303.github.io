## Ruming Liu

My name is Ruming Liu (刘入铭), I am currently a Finance Ph.D. candidate at Stevens Institute of Technology([SIT](https://www.stevens.edu)), my research interests are Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and Fintech.([Resume](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document/blob/main/021924Ruming_Liu_Resume.pdf))

Before SIT, I was a Financial Engineering Client Service Specialist at Moody's Analytics([MA](https://www.moodysanalytics.com)) in San Francisco. I supported some Credit Risk Products and Credit Rating data of Moody's: CreditEdge, RiskCalc, RiskFrontier and Moody's Investor Service(MIS) rating data. 

I got my Master's degree of Mathematical Finance at University of Southern California([USC](https://www.usc.edu)) in 2021 in the United States and got my Bachelor's degree of Finance at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics([JUFE](http://english.jxufe.edu.cn)) in 2019 in China. I also attended the Extension Program of Statistics at University of California, San Diego([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu)) in 2018 in the United States.

During my undergraduate study, I attended some internship programs at China International Capital Corporation([CICC](https://en.cicc.com)) as Derivative Analyst, China Merchant Bank([CMB](https://english.cmbchina.com)) as Financial Data Analyst, China International Trust and Investment Corporation([CITIC](https://www.citic.com/en/#Businesses)) as Stock Trading Assistant. 
 
## Projects and Articles
I am quite interested in quantitaive investment, quantitative risk management and decentralized finance topics. I wrote some articles (Including Financial Mathematics, Statistics, Probability, Defi, Simulation, etc) during the past few years, some of them are wrote in Chinese and published on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/liu-ru-ming-8/posts), the rest are wrote in English and can be found in my [Github repository](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document). I also did some academic projects during my University study. These projects and articles can also be found below. 

### Researches and Projects
- [Sentiment in the Cross Section of Cryptocurrency Returns(EN)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941032): _We find an anomoly associated with the cryptocurrency market sentiment. Our findings indicate that cryptos with high sensitivities to sentiment tend to yield lower returns in the following period. We introduce a sentiment factor to explain the sentiment-related anomoly._ 

1. Qualified for Best Paper Award at 2024 International Conference of Taiwan Finance Association \(declined by authors due to adherence to publication restrictions\)

- [Pricing and Arbitrage Across 80 Cryptocurrency Exchanges(EN)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4816710#paper-references-widget): _We explore variations in cryptocurrency pricing across 80 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. Arbitrage spreads are higher in non-US domiciled exchanges, decentralized exchanges, non-trustworthy, and relatively illiquid exchanges. Stablecoins exhibit smaller arbitrage spreads than other tokens._
- [Front-running Game Between Miners and Traders in Blockchain(EN)](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document/blob/main/Front_running_Game_in_Blockchain.pdf): _We discussed the equlibrium model of a game in DPoS. We form a signalling game between the miners (validators) and traders (voters). We analyze some situations in which the DPoS blockchain may fail. We discuss in some situations, blockchain can work under the collaboration._
- [The Thoughts on the Internationalization of Chinese RMB(EN)](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document/blob/main/Toughts%20on%20the%20Internationalization%20of%20Chinese%20RMB%20%7C%20Ruming%20Liu.pdf): 
_The dissertation of my Bachelor's Degree. It compares the development of RMB with other international currencies and forecasts the future of RMB from macro-economics and politics point of view._
- [A Possible Way to Search Pairs Trading Arbitrage(EN)](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document/blob/main/A%20Possible%20Way%20to%20Search%20Pairs%20Trading%20Arbitrage.pdf):
_Directed Research of my Master's program. It finds a new possible way to search stock pairs which exist arbitrage opportunity and uses dynamic programming method to make trading strategy._
- [Cointegration Method of Statistical Arbitrage(EN)](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document/blob/main/Cointegration%20Method%20of%20Pairs%20Trading.pdf):
_Time Series and Econometrics course project. It applies cointegration method and ARMA-GARCH model to analyze spread in stock market, and forecasts the convergence situation of the spread._
