## About Me

My name is Ruming Liu, I am currently working on Financial Engineering Client Service Specialist at Moody's Analytics in San Francisco. (Here is my latest [Resume](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document/blob/main/Ruming%20Liu%20Resume_202110.pdf))

Before Moody's Analytics, I got my Master's degree of Mathematical Finance at University of Southern California in the United States and got my Bachelor's degree of Finance at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics in China. 

During my undergraduate study, I attent some internship programs at China International Capital Corporation(CICC) as Derivative Analyst, China Merchant Bank(CMB) as Financial Data Analyst, China International Trust and Investment Corporation(CITIC) as Stock Trading Assistant. 
 
## Projects and Articles
I am quited interested in quantitaive investment and quantitative risk management topics. I wrote some articles (Including Financial Mathematics, Statistics, Probability, Simulation, etc) during the past few years, some of them are wrote in Chinese and published on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/liu-ru-ming-8/posts), the rest are wrote in English and can be found in my [Github repository](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document). I also did some academic projects during my University study. These projects and articles can also be found below.
