I am quited interested in quantitaive investment and quantitative risk management topics. I wrote some articles (Including Financial Mathematics, Statistics, Probability, Simulation, etc) during the past few years, some of them are wrote in Chinese and published on [Zhihu](), the rest are wrote in English and can be found in my [Github repository](). I also did some academic projects during my University study. These projects and articles can also be found below.
