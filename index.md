I'm also a co-founder of social media [ideaGround LLC](https://ideaground.github.io), we are actively hiring talented blockchain scientists and seeking pre-seed and seed round funding. If you're interested in joining our team or supporting our vision, please don’t hesitate to get in touch!

Previously, I was a Financial Engineering Client Service Specialist at Moody's Analytics ([MA](https://www.moodysanalytics.com)) in San Francisco. I supported some credit risk products and credit rating data of Moody's: CreditEdge, RiskCalc, RiskFrontier and Moody's Investor Service(MIS) rating data. 

I earned my Master's degree of Mathematical Finance at University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.usc.edu)) in 2021 in the United States and earned my Bachelor's degree of Finance at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics ([JUFE](http://english.jxufe.edu.cn)) in 2019 in China. I also attended the Extension Program of Statistics at University of California, San Diego ([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu)) in 2018 in the United States.

During my undergraduate study, I attended some internship programs at China International Capital Corporation ([CICC](https://en.cicc.com)) as Derivative Analyst, China Merchant Bank ([CMB](https://english.cmbchina.com)) as Financial Data Analyst, China International Trust and Investment Corporation ([CITIC](https://www.citic.com/en/#Businesses)) as Stock Trading Assistant. 
 
## Projects and Articles
I am quite interested in quantitaive investment, quantitative risk management and decentralized finance topics. I wrote some articles (Including Financial Mathematics, Statistics, Probability, Defi, Simulation, etc) during the past few years, some of them are wrote in Chinese and published on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/liu-ru-ming-8/posts), the rest are wrote in English and can be found in my [Github repository](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document). I also did some academic projects during my University study. These projects and articles can also be found below. 

### Researches and Projects
- [Sentiment in the Cross Section of Cryptocurrency Returns(EN)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941032): _We find an anomoly associated with the cryptocurrency market sentiment.
