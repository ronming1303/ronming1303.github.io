<!-- ## Projects and Articles
I am quite interested in quantitaive investment, quantitative risk management and decentralized finance topics. I wrote some articles (Including Financial Mathematics, Statistics, Probability, Defi, Simulation, etc) during the past few years, some of them are wrote in Chinese and published on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/liu-ru-ming-8/posts), the rest are wrote in English and can be found in my [Github repository](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document). I also did some academic projects during my University study. These projects and articles can also be found below.  -->

## Research Papers
1. [Sentiment in the Cross Section of Cryptocurrency Returns(EN)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941032)
- _We find an anomoly associated with the cryptocurrency market sentiment. Our findings indicate that cryptos with high sensitivities to sentiment tend to yield lower returns in the following period. We introduce a sentiment factor to explain the sentiment-related anomoly._ [<span style="color: red"><u>Keynote Here</u></span>](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document/blob/main/CryptoSentiment_FMA2024.pdf)
<!-- 1. Qualified for Best Paper Award at 2024 International Conference of Taiwan Finance Association \(declined by authors due to adherence to publication restrictions\) -->
2. [Pricing and Arbitrage Across 80 Cryptocurrency Exchanges(EN)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4816710#paper-references-widget)

Arbitrage spreads are higher in non-US domiciled exchanges, decentralized exchanges, non-trustworthy, and relatively illiquid exchanges. Stablecoins exhibit smaller arbitrage spreads than other tokens._ [<span style="color: red"><u>Keynote Here</u></span>](https://github.com/ronming1303/Ruming-Liu-PDF-Document/blob/main/CryptoExchangeArbitrage.pdf)
